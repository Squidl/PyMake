PyMake
======

My small library to use python to process files.

## Features
## Application
Because this is an attempt to recreate Make in a python context (as opposed to bash) there is a big difference in application. Since bash is so closely linked with command line usage it is very useful for compiling and other operating system tasks. While it is possible to trigger commands from Python, that is not its main usage. This means the application of this library will be more geared towards data proccessing and other pythonic applications.
